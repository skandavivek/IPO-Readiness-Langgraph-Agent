        "# Plan-and-Execute\n",
        "\n",
        "This notebook shows how to create a \"plan-and-execute\" style agent. This is heavily inspired by the [Plan-and-Solve](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.04091) paper as well as the [Baby-AGI](https://github.com/yoheinakajima/babyagi) project.\n",
        "\n",
        "The core idea is to first come up with a multi-step plan, and then go through that plan one item at a time.\n",
        "After accomplishing a particular task, you can then revisit the plan and modify as appropriate.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "This compares to a typical [ReAct](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03629) style agent where you think one step at a time.\n",
        "The advantages of this \"plan-and-execute\" style agent are:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Explicit long term planning (which even really strong LLMs can struggle with)\n",
        "2. Ability to use smaller/weaker models for the execution step, only using larger/better models for the planning step\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "The following walkthrough demonstrates how to do so in LangGraph. The resulting agent will leave a trace like the following example: ([link](https://smith.langchain.com/public/d46e24d3-dda6-44d5-9550-b618fca4e0d4/r))."

This significant growth reflects the company's strong market position and its ability to expand its customer base.\\n  - **Shareholder Equity:** Toast has a total shareholder equity of $1.4 billion, with total debt being $0.0. This indicates a strong financial foundation with no reliance on debt, highlighting its readiness for the IPO from a financial stability perspective.\\n  - **Debt-to-Equity Ratio:** With a debt-to-equity ratio of 0%, Toast showcases exceptional financial health, which is a strong indicator of its ability to sustain operations without needing external debt financing.\\n\\n- **Marqeta:**\\n  - **Revenue and Profits:** In the last 12 months, Marqeta reported a revenue of $490.03 million and profits of $14.03 million, with earnings per share being $0.03. While the revenue is considerable, it's notably lower than that of Toast, suggesting that Marqeta might need to bolster its market presence.\\n  - **IPO Fundraising:** Marqeta raised $1.2 billion during its IPO, with the company being valued at roughly $12 billion at the midpoint of its expected IPO price range ($22/share). This successful fundraising effort points to strong investor confidence and a positive market reception.\\n\\n### Margin Metrics\\n\\n- **Toast Inc** does not have explicit margin metrics available in the retrieved data. However, the lack of debt and significant revenue growth suggest healthy profit margins and operational efficiency.\\n  \\n- **Marqeta**'s earnings details hint at tighter margins, given its profit figures relative to revenue. The specifics of gross and net margin metrics need further investigation for a closer comparison.\\n\\n### Forward Guidance Accuracy\\n\\n- **Toast Inc:** The provided data lacks specific forward guidance disclosures from Toast, making it challenging to assess the accuracy of its future earnings and growth projections at this stage.\\n  \\n- **Marqeta:** Similarly, for Marqeta, the retrieved data does not include detailed forward guidance or comparisons of past projections with actual outcomes, necessitating further research to evaluate its forecasting accuracy and reliability.\\n\\n### Conclusion\\n\\nWhen comparing Toast Inc's and Marqeta's IPO readiness based on available financial metrics, margin metrics, and the limited information on forward guidance accuracy, Toast appears to have a stronger financial foundation, demonstrated by its higher revenue, non-reliance on debt, and potentially better profit margins.
